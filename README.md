## Abstract

Our team's strategy is to analyze customer behavior patterns within the client's existing data to identify actionable insights. We plan to supplement this primary data with alternative sources to provide a holistic view of market trends. This approach is intended to inform the client's strategic decisions effectively.

## Objectives

We aim to derive actionable insights from the data that will enable our client to improve their market position and exploit opportunities. Our goal is to deliver a thorough analysis that exceeds the client's expectations.

## Team Composition and Division of Labour

Our team includes Slava, Maxim, Alykhan, and Shoh. Each member will initially partake in data cleaning. Specific tasks include:

Slava: Clean and project POS Factory data.

Maxim: Clean and project Customer DC Inventory data.

Alykhan: Clean and project Total Sales data.

Shoh: Clean and project E-commerce POS data. Utilize Placer.ai for alternative data collection.

We will assign presentation responsibilities based on individual contributions to ensure equity and coherence.

## Data Cleaning and Organization

Data cleaning is our first priority. We'll address the missing 10 weeks of 2023 data by employing linear regression projections to all need states. This will normalize the data, after which we will focus on removing outliers if any exist.

## External Data Sources

Our analysis will incorporate additional data sources identified during the project to complement our primary dataset and enhance our insights. Some brainstormed data may include UV index, temperature, humidity levels for skincare, disposable income levels, brand perception, search trends, etc.


## Technologies and Techniques

We will employ BeautifulSoup and Scrapy for web scraping, regex for data manipulation, and Python's linear regression tools for data projection. Shoh will introduce Placer.ai for alternative data insights.

## Conclusion

We are committed to delivering a comprehensive and precise analysis. By leveraging advanced tools and a focused approach, we are confident in our ability to provide valuable insights for the client's strategic use.
